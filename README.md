# Capstone-PiCar
ESE 499 Capstone Design Project

This is the repository on which we can upload all of our code regarding the Capstone Senior Design Project! :)


To begin with, original test code will be provided that outlines the functionality of each sensor that is used and how it is utilized/verified. So far we have:

 -IPmail.py
      *Description of code used to send an email givin the IP address of the PI. Useful for those that don't have a monitor or keyboard nearby and want access to their PI
      *Make sure to run this in the autostart file of the PI. If you do not have an autostart file already made, create one!
      
      
 -Ultrasonic.py
      *Description of code used to verify the functionality of the ultrasonic sensor used in the creation of this PiCar. The model number of the ultrasonic used is *FIX*
